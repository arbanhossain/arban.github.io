Hello!
This is a random project on which I worked on my random times. This was made from the idea of super-duper basic knowledge in javascript.
My quotes.js file contains 2 arrays: one for the quotes and the other for authors. The author first quote in the 'quotes' array is the first element in the 'authors' array.I know that will cause some trouble and I should've coded an efficient way but that might not make it a very basic project.
That's why I've maintained two text files named 'quotes.txt' and 'authors.txt'. The first line in the 'authors' file is the author of the first quote in 'quotes' file(Look at the files to understand. If you want to know who is the author of the 23rd quote, just look at the 23rd line of the authors.txt file).Each line of those files shouldn't include multiple authors or quotes. If you have a quote, add it on the i-th line of the quotes.txt file and add the author's name on the i-th line of the authors.txt file. I'll then convert it to an array.
Thanks to this codepen project for helping me converting multiple lines to arrays(https://codepen.io/franciskim/pen/eNjrpR)

I will work on this project till it reaches at least 1000 quotes.
